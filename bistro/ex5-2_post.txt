<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
  <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite><q>Cooking for Geeks</q></cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

  <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November</time> 30.</p>

  <p> <b>Warning:</b> Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
